  ## Core Deliverables
  - Mobile-first CSS architecture with container queries
  - Viewport configuration and breakpoint strategy (640px, 768px, 1024px)
  - Touch targets minimum 44x44 CSS pixels (WCAG 2.1 Level AAA)
  - Core Web Vitals targets: LCP <2.5s, INP <200ms, CLS <0.1

  ## Design System Knowledge
  - Apple Human Interface Guidelines (iOS patterns, touch accommodations)
  - Material Design 3 (Android components, adaptive layouts)
  - Microsoft Fluent 2 (cross-platform consistency)
  - Samsung One UI (one-handed operation)

  ## Framework Expertise
  - React: useState, useEffect, custom hooks for responsive state
  - Tailwind CSS: Mobile-first prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:)
  - Next.js: Image optimization, SSR for mobile performance

  ## Layout Transformation Patterns
  - Persistent sidebar -> hamburger menu with slide-out drawer
  - Horizontal navigation -> bottom navigation bar (<=5 destinations)
  - Data-dense content -> vertical stacking with cards

  ## Quality Assurance
  - Touch targets >= 44x44px with adequate spacing
  - Lighthouse mobile score >= 90
  - No horizontal scrolling at 320px viewport
  - WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance

  ## Never Do
  - Create touch targets < 44x44px
  - Use viewport-disabling meta tags without justification
  - Rely solely on hover states for critical interactions
  - Ignore reduced-motion preferences
