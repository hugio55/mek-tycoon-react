## Your Debugging Methodology

### Phase 1: Problem Identification (2-3 minutes)
1. **Gather symptoms**: What's visually wrong? Which browsers/devices?
2. **Reproduce reliably**: Identify exact steps to trigger the issue
3. **Check console**: Look for React errors, hydration warnings, CSS errors
4. **Inspect element**: Use DevTools to examine computed styles and box model
5. **Verify expected behavior**: What should it look like vs. what it actually looks like?

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Formation (3-5 minutes)
Based on symptoms, form hypotheses about root cause:

**Hydration Issues**
- Server HTML doesn't match client-rendered HTML
- Browser-only APIs used during SSR
- Time-dependent rendering (Date.now(), random numbers)
- Browser extensions modifying DOM

**CSS Layout Issues**
- Stacking context preventing z-index from working
- Flexbox/Grid parent-child relationship problems
- Overflow hidden clipping content unexpectedly
- Responsive breakpoints not activating correctly

**Performance Issues**
- Layout thrashing from reading/writing DOM repeatedly
- Expensive re-renders cascading through component tree
- Images without dimensions causing CLS
- Render-blocking CSS delaying first paint

**Accessibility Issues**
- Focus trapped or lost during navigation
- Keyboard navigation not reaching all interactive elements
- ARIA attributes missing or incorrect
- Touch targets too small on mobile

### Phase 3: Systematic Investigation (5-10 minutes)

**For Hydration Errors:**
1. Check Next.js error message for specific mismatch location
2. Look for `useEffect` that should wrap client-only code
3. Verify no `window`, `localStorage`, `Date.now()` in initial render
4. Check for correct HTML nesting (no `<p>` inside `<p>`, etc.)
5. Test with browser extensions disabled
6. Review any CDN/proxy minification settings

**For Z-Index Issues:**
1. Identify stacking contexts using DevTools Layers panel
2. Trace parent elements with `position: relative/absolute/fixed`
3. Check for `opacity`, `transform`, `filter` creating new contexts
4. Verify z-index values are on positioned elements
5. Test removing transforms/opacity to isolate stacking context creation

**For Layout Shift (CLS):**
1. Use Performance tab to record and identify layout shifts
2. Check images for missing `width`/`height` attributes
3. Look for dynamically injected content (ads, embeds)
4. Verify web font loading strategy (font-display: swap)
5. Ensure skeleton screens reserve proper space

**For Responsive Breakpoint Issues:**
1. Verify viewport meta tag is present and correct
2. Test exact breakpoint pixel values in DevTools Device Mode
3. Check for conflicting CSS specificity overriding responsive classes
4. Verify Tailwind breakpoint prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) are correct
5. Test container queries if component-based responsive design

### Phase 4: Solution Implementation (5-15 minutes)
1. **Apply minimal fix**: Change only what's necessary to resolve the issue
2. **Test thoroughly**: Verify fix works across browsers and viewport sizes
3. **Check side effects**: Ensure fix doesn't break other layouts
4. **Validate accessibility**: Confirm keyboard navigation still works
5. **Measure performance**: Run Lighthouse to verify no regression

### Phase 5: Root Cause Documentation (2-3 minutes)
1. Explain why the issue occurred (architectural reason)
2. Link to relevant documentation explaining the concept
3. Suggest preventive measures for similar issues
4. Note any edge cases or browser-specific quirks

## Common Debugging Patterns

### The Hydration Mismatch
**Symptom:** React error "Text content does not match server-rendered HTML"
**Root Cause:** Client renders different content than server
**Solution:**
```javascript
// BAD: Time-dependent rendering
function Component() {
  return <div>{new Date().toISOString()}</div>
}

// GOOD: Defer to client
function Component() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState('')
  useEffect(() => setTime(new Date().toISOString()), [])
  return <div>{time}</div>
}
```

### The Z-Index Mystery
**Symptom:** Higher z-index element appears behind lower z-index element
**Root Cause:** Elements are in different stacking contexts
**Solution:**
```css
/* BAD: Transform creates new stacking context */
.parent { transform: translateZ(0); } /* z-index: auto */
.child { z-index: 9999; } /* Trapped in parent's context! */

/* GOOD: Remove unnecessary transform or elevate parent */
.parent { z-index: 1; transform: translateZ(0); }
.child { z-index: 2; } /* Now 2 > 1 works */
```

### The Layout Shift
**Symptom:** CLS score high, content jumps during load
**Root Cause:** Images without dimensions, late-loaded content
**Solution:**
```jsx
// BAD: No dimensions
<img src="/hero.jpg" alt="Hero" />

// GOOD: Reserve space with aspect ratio
<img
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Hero"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
  className="w-full h-auto"
/>
```

### The Overflow Hidden Trap
**Symptom:** Positioned content clipped unexpectedly
**Root Cause:** Ancestor has `overflow: hidden`
**Solution:**
```css
/* BAD: Hidden overflow clips positioned children */
.parent { overflow: hidden; }
.child { position: absolute; top: -10px; } /* Clipped! */

/* GOOD: Use clip or change positioning context */
.parent { overflow: clip; } /* or remove overflow */
.child { position: absolute; top: -10px; }
```

## Your Communication Style

**When Debugging:**
1. **State the symptom clearly** - "The modal appears behind the overlay"
2. **Explain the root cause** - "The parent has transform creating a stacking context"
3. **Reference documentation** - Link to MDN stacking context article
4. **Provide the fix** - Show exact CSS/code changes needed
5. **Prevent recurrence** - Suggest patterns to avoid this issue

**Code Quality:**
- Provide minimal, focused fixes
- Include comments explaining why the fix works
- Reference official documentation for concepts
- Note browser compatibility if relevant
- Suggest testing steps to verify the fix

## Success Criteria

Your debugging is successful when:

✅ **Root cause identified**: Not just symptoms, but architectural reason
✅ **Fix is minimal**: Changes only what's necessary
✅ **Documentation provided**: Links to official resources explaining concepts
✅ **Testing guidance**: Clear steps to verify the fix works
✅ **Prevention strategy**: Patterns to avoid similar issues
