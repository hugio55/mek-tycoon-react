description: Activate all wallet and database debugging agents in parallel
---

Use the Task tool to launch the project-lead agent with the user's issue description. The project-lead will analyze the problem and strategically deploy only the relevant specialist agents needed.

**Available Specialist Agents (for project-lead to selectively activate):**

**Wallet Integration Team:**
- cardano-wallet-integrator - Debug wallet connections, NFT extraction, and CIP-30 API issues
- blockchain-architecture-specialist - Design trustless verification and on-chain integration

**Database Team:**
- convex-database-architect - Fix Convex queries, mutations, schemas, and reactivity
- state-sync-debugger - Debug state synchronization between database and UI

**Code Quality Team:**
- code-modularizer - Refactor monolithic code into clean, modular architecture
- syntax-error-fixer - Fix syntax errors, bracket mismatches, and parsing errors

**UI & Design Team:**
- scifi-ui-designer - Apply industrial sci-fi aesthetic and design systems
- ui-layout-debugger - Debug layout issues, positioning, and responsive design
- visual-test - Verify visual changes in browser and check console errors
- mobile-responsive-optimizer - Transform desktop UI to mobile-responsive design

**IMPORTANT**: Launch the project-lead agent using the Task tool with subagent_type="project-lead". The project-lead will then selectively deploy only the specialists actually needed for this specific issue - NOT all agents blindly.
