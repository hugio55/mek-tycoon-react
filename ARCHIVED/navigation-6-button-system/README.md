# 6-Button Navigation System Archive

**Date Archived:** October 22, 2025
**Reason:** Migrating to unified Pattern 2 header system

## What Was Archived

This directory contains the old navigation system that featured:
- Large "MEK TYCOON" logo on the left
- 6 dropdown menu buttons arranged in a 3x2 grid:
  - Operations (Essence)
  - Production (Crafting, Incinerator, Shop, Bank, Inventory)
  - Meks (CiruTree, Achievements, XP Allocation, Spell Caster)
  - Management (Profile, Search, Leaderboard, Federation)
  - Scrap Yard (Contracts, Single Missions, Story Mode, Story Climb)
  - Admin (30+ admin tools)
- HUB button with special styling
- User stats overlay (top-left corner)
- Controls (top-right: disconnect, sound toggle, welcome link)

## Files

- `Navigation.tsx` - Main navigation component (657 lines)

## Replaced By

New unified header system based on Pattern 2:
- Component: `/src/components/UnifiedHeader.tsx`
- Features: Mek count dropdown + company logo (top-right)
- Cleaner, more streamlined design
- Single source of truth for all pages

## Notes

The welcome page (/) and talent-builder (/talent-builder) remain exceptions with no header.

If you need to restore this navigation system, copy Navigation.tsx back to `/src/components/` and update `/src/app/providers.tsx` to import and use it.
