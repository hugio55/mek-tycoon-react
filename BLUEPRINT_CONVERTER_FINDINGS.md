## Research Process

### Phase 1: Experimental Testing (10 Methods)

Tested 10 different advanced edge detection techniques:

1. **Enhanced Canny** - Multiple Canny passes with bilateral filtering
2. **Sobel + Laplacian Hybrid** - Gradient magnitude combined with Laplacian
3. **Contour-Based** - Adaptive threshold + contour approximation ⭐ WINNER
4. **Skeleton Thinning** - Morphological skeletonization
5. **Multi-Scale Edges** - Edge detection at multiple Gaussian scales
6. **Scharr Operator** - More accurate gradient operator than Sobel
7. **Adaptive Canny** - Strong/weak edge combination with hysteresis
8. **Edge-Preserving Filter** - edgePreservingFilter before detection
9. **Double Threshold Refinement** - Custom hysteresis implementation
10. **Combined Best Practices** - Multi-method combination

### Phase 2: Top 3 Candidate Testing

Selected top 3 methods and tested on diverse Mek images:
- Method 3: Contour-Based ⭐
- Method 2: Sobel + Laplacian
- Method 7: Adaptive Canny

**Result:** Method 3 (Contour-Based) consistently produced the cleanest, most continuous lines across all test images.

## Winning Method: Enhanced Contour-Based Edge Detection

### Why It Won

1. **Clean Continuous Lines** - Contour approximation creates smooth, connected lines
2. **Preserves Internal Detail** - Canny edges add fine structural elements
3. **Professional Appearance** - Looks like hand-drawn technical blueprints
4. **Consistent Results** - Works well on all Mek variations tested
5. **Fast Performance** - 0.32s single-threaded, 0.12s with 4 threads

### Technical Approach

```
Stage 1: Edge-Preserving Smoothing
└─> Bilateral filter (9px, sigma=75) - removes noise, keeps edges sharp

Stage 2: Adaptive Thresholding
└─> Gaussian adaptive threshold - creates clean regions for contours

Stage 3: Contour Extraction
└─> findContours with RETR_TREE - captures outline hierarchy

Stage 4: Contour Approximation
└─> approxPolyDP with epsilon=0.002-0.005 - simplifies to clean lines
└─> Filters out tiny contours (area < 5px) to remove noise

Stage 5: Internal Detail Addition
└─> Canny edges (20-80 thresholds) - captures fine internal structure
└─> Weighted blend: 70% contours + 40% Canny

Stage 6: Line Refinement
└─> Morphological closing (2x2 ellipse kernel) - connects nearby lines
```

### Key Parameters

- **Detail Level:** `high` (epsilon=0.002), `medium` (0.003), `low` (0.005)
- **Canny Thresholds:** 20-80 (high), 30-100 (medium), 40-120 (low)
- **Blend Weights:** 0.7 contours + 0.4 Canny edges
- **Grid Size:** 30px minor, 150px major grid lines

## Production Script Usage

### File: `blueprint-converter-optimized.py`

### Single Image Conversion
```bash
python blueprint-converter-optimized.py input.webp output.png
```

### Batch Processing (Recommended for 4,000 images)
```bash
# Process all images in directory
python blueprint-converter-optimized.py \
  --batch public/mek-images/1000px \
  --output-dir blueprints \
  --threads 8 \
  --style blue \
  --detail high
```

### Advanced Options

**Style Options:**
- `--style blue` - Classic blueprint blue (default)
- `--style dark_blue` - Darker blue variant
- `--style navy` - Deep navy blue

**Detail Levels:**
- `--detail high` - Maximum detail (recommended, epsilon=0.002)
- `--detail medium` - Balanced (epsilon=0.003)
- `--detail low` - Cleaner but less detail (epsilon=0.005)

**Grid Options:**
- `--grid-size 30` - Default 30px spacing
- `--grid-size 25` - Tighter grid
- `--no-grid` - Disable grid overlay

**Performance:**
- `--threads 4` - Default 4 parallel threads
- `--threads 8` - Faster on 8+ core CPUs
- `--threads 1` - Single-threaded (for debugging)

---

## Batch Processing Recommendations

### For All 4,000 Mek Images

**Recommended Command:**
```bash
python blueprint-converter-optimized.py \
  --batch public/mek-images/1000px \
  --output-dir public/mek-images/blueprints \
  --pattern "*.webp" \
  --threads 8 \
  --style blue \
  --detail high \
  --grid-size 30
```

**Expected Performance:**
- With 8 threads: ~0.08s per image
- Total time for 4,000 images: ~5-6 minutes
- Output size: ~150-250KB per blueprint PNG

**Storage Requirements:**
- Input: 4,000 images × ~800KB = ~3.2 GB
- Output: 4,000 images × ~200KB = ~800 MB
- Total: ~4 GB

### Quality Verification

After batch processing, manually review a sample:
```bash
# Check a few random outputs
ls blueprints/*.png | shuf -n 10
```

Look for:
- Continuous, clean white lines
- Visible grid overlay (subtle but present)
- Good internal detail preservation
- No broken/dotty lines
- Classic blueprint blue background

## Technical Insights

### What Makes Professional Technical Drawings

1. **Continuous Lines** - No broken segments or gaps
2. **Clean Edges** - Smooth curves without jagged pixels
3. **Detail Balance** - Show structure without overwhelming noise
4. **Line Weight** - Consistent thickness (~1-2px)
5. **Grid Integration** - Subtle but visible reference grid
6. **Color Scheme** - Classic blueprint blue + white lines

### Why Other Methods Failed

- **Pure Canny:** Too fragmented, creates dotty lines
- **Sobel/Laplacian:** Good edges but lacks continuous outlines
- **Skeleton Thinning:** Too thin, loses structural information
- **Multi-Scale:** Computational overhead without quality gain
- **Double Threshold:** Similar to Canny but more complex

### Why Contour-Based Succeeds

- **Outline First:** Captures complete object boundaries
- **Approximation:** Reduces points while maintaining shape
- **Detail Layer:** Canny adds internal structure separately
- **Morphological:** Connects nearby segments naturally
- **Filtering:** Removes noise early in pipeline
