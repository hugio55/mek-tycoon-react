# Mek Tycoon - Project Instructions

## Claude Code Documentation
Local documentation is available in the `claude-code-docs/` directory:
- **Main docs**: Overview, quickstart, workflows, troubleshooting, etc.
- **SDK docs**: `claude-code-docs/sdk/` - Headless mode, TypeScript/Python SDKs
- **Enterprise**: Bedrock, Vertex AI, proxy config, LLM gateways

## Quick Start Command
When user says "start it up" or similar, run:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Ben Meyers\Documents\Mek Tycoon\mek-tycoon-react" && npm run dev:all
```
This starts both Next.js (port 3100) and Convex in one terminal.

## Project Overview
Mek Tycoon is a web-based idle/tycoon game featuring collectible Mek NFTs. The game combines resource management, crafting, and collection mechanics with a sleek, futuristic UI.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.6 (App Router), React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3 (NOT v4!) with custom glass-morphism effects
- **Database**: Convex (real-time backend)
- **Blockchain**: Cardano (wallet integration via MeshSDK - currently disabled)

## CRITICAL: Tailwind CSS Version Management
**‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS CHECK FIRST: This project uses Tailwind CSS v3, NOT v4!**

### If styles appear broken (plain text appearance):
1. **IMMEDIATELY CHECK** package.json for Tailwind version (must be ^3.x.x, NOT ^4.x.x)
2. **FIX IMMEDIATELY** if wrong:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss
   npm install -D tailwindcss@^3 postcss autoprefixer
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev:all
   ```

### Required Config Files (DO NOT DELETE):
- `tailwind.config.ts` - v3 configuration
- `postcss.config.mjs` - Must use `{tailwindcss: {}, autoprefixer: {}}`
- `src/app/globals.css` - Must use `@tailwind base/components/utilities`

### NEVER USE:
- `npm update` (can break version locks)
- `npm install tailwindcss@latest` (installs v4)
- `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax (v4 only)
- `@theme inline` directive (v4 only)
- `@tailwindcss/postcss` package (v4 only)

### ALWAYS USE:
- `npm ci` when possible (respects lock file)
- `npm install` without version specifier (respects package.json)
- Check CRITICAL_DEPENDENCIES.md if issues arise

## Visual Testing with Playwright

### Available Testing Commands
- **`/visual-check`** - Verify visual changes are working in browser
- **`@visual-test`** - Activate visual testing agent for detailed inspection

### What Gets Tested
1. **Visual Changes**: Screenshots before/after to confirm changes
2. **Console Errors**: Monitor for JavaScript errors or warnings
3. **Interactions**: Click, hover, and focus states
4. **Responsiveness**: Different viewport sizes
5. **Animations**: Smooth transitions and effects

### Example Usage
- `/visual-check - verify the save button turned green`
- `/visual-check - check if mek template modal opens`
- `@visual-test check if the talent tree nodes are centered on click`

## Design Requirements

### üé® INDUSTRIAL DESIGN SYSTEM (NEW!)
**Reference Implementation:** `/contracts/single-missions` page

The site uses an **Industrial/Military** aesthetic with the following key elements:

#### Core Visual Identity
- **Frames**: Sharp edges with yellow/gold borders (`border-2 border-yellow-500/50`)
- **Translucence**: Glass-morphism with backdrop blur effects
- **Textures**: Black and yellow hazard stripes, metal scratches, rust effects
- **Typography**: 'Orbitron' for headers (uppercase, tracking-wider)

#### Design System Files
- **CSS Classes**: `/src/styles/global-design-system.css`
- **JS/TS Utils**: `/src/lib/design-system.ts`

#### Key Patterns to Use
1. **Industrial Cards**: 
   ```css
   .mek-card-industrial /* Translucent with grunge overlays */
   .mek-border-sharp-gold /* Yellow bordered frames */
   ```

2. **Hazard Stripes**:
   ```css
   .mek-overlay-hazard-stripes /* 45deg black/yellow stripes */
   .mek-overlay-diagonal-stripes /* 135deg subtle stripes */
   ```

3. **Grunge Effects**:
   ```css
   .mek-overlay-scratches /* Metal wear marks */
   .mek-overlay-rust /* Rust and stain patterns */
   .mek-overlay-metal-texture /* Industrial grid texture */
   ```

4. **Typography Classes**:
   ```css
   .mek-value-primary /* Large yellow numbers */
   .mek-label-uppercase /* Small gray uppercase labels */
   .mek-text-industrial /* Orbitron bold uppercase */
   ```

5. **Interactive Elements**:
   ```css
   .mek-button-primary /* Angled yellow button */
   .mek-slot-empty /* Dashed border slots */
   .mek-glow-yellow /* Yellow glow effects */
   ```

### Visual Style Guidelines
- **Primary Color**: Yellow/Gold (#fab617)
- **Backgrounds**: Deep blacks with subtle gradients
- **Borders**: Sharp or slightly rounded with yellow accents
- **Effects**: Glass morphism, scan lines, holographic shimmers
- **Animations**: Subtle pulses, no flashy/distracting effects

### UI Components
- Navigation with dropdown menus for 6 categories
- Large logo at top with subtle shimmer effect
- HUB button with special styling
- Cards with industrial frames and grunge overlays
- Progress bars with yellow gradient fills
- Slots with dashed borders and hazard patterns

## Important Data Structure

### Mek Variations (from CSV)
- **102 Head Variations** (not 103)
- **112 Body Variations**
- **95 Trait Variations**

### Mek Images Location
**IMPORTANT**: All Mek images are stored in:
```
C:\Users\Ben Meyers\Documents\Mek Tycoon\TYCOON REACT 8-27\mek-tycoon-react\public\mek-images\
```
- Images are organized by size: `150px/`, `500px/`, `1000px/`
- Use path `/mek-images/150px/[variation-codes].webp` in components
- Files are in WebP format
- Named by variation codes: `[head]-[body]-[item].webp` (e.g., "bc2-dm1-ap1.webp")

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Mek Image Linking Issues**
When linking Mek images, you MUST handle these two issues:
1. **Suffix Removal**: Database sourceKeys have suffixes like "-B", "-C" that must be removed
   - Example: `"AA1-AA4-GH1-B"` ‚Üí `"AA1-AA4-GH1"`
   - Use regex: `.replace(/-[A-Z]$/, '')`
2. **Case Conversion**: Database uses UPPERCASE, but files are lowercase
   - Example: `"AA1-AA4-GH1"` ‚Üí `"aa1-aa4-gh1"`
   - Always use `.toLowerCase()`

**Correct Implementation:**
```javascript
const cleanKey = selectedMek.sourceKey
  .replace(/-[A-Z]$/, '')  // Remove suffix
  .toLowerCase();           // Convert to lowercase
const imagePath = `/mek-images/150px/${cleanKey}.webp`;
```

### Crafting System Hierarchy
The crafting system follows this flow:
1. Select Component Type (Heads/Bodies/Traits)
2. Select Group (e.g., Cameras & Film, Musical, Materials)
3. Select Style (specific variation from that group)
4. Select Final Variation (complete the crafting)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use functional React components with TypeScript
- Prefer `const` over `let` when possible
- Use proper TypeScript types (avoid `any`)
- Keep components modular and reusable

### File Structure
```
src/
  app/           # Next.js app router pages
  components/    # Reusable components
  contexts/      # React contexts
  lib/           # Utility functions
convex/          # Backend functions and schema
public/          # Static assets
```

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **CSS/Styling broken (plain text appearance)**: Check Tailwind version! Must be v3, not v4. See "CRITICAL: Tailwind CSS Version Management" section above
2. **Port conflicts**: Dev server may use ports 3000-3007+
3. **Wallet integration**: Currently disabled (WalletConnect commented out)
4. **styled-jsx errors**: NEVER use styled-jsx - causes Jest/webpack errors. Use global CSS or Tailwind classes instead
5. **Jest worker errors**: Remove ALL `<style jsx>` blocks from components

## Key Features

### Implemented
- Hub page with gold collection mechanics
- Profile page with Mek management
- Crafting system with hierarchical selection
- Navigation with dropdown menus
- Real-time data updates via Convex

### Pending/Future
- Wallet integration (Cardano/MeshSDK)
- Marketplace/Auction House
- Battle system
- Minigames
- Achievement system

## Testing Commands
```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
npx tsc --noEmit   # TypeScript type checking
```

## Slash Commands

### `/ui-team` - Activate all UI agents
When user types `/ui-team`, activate these three agents together:
- `@ui-layout-debugger` - Debug layout issues
- `@scifi-ui-designer` - Apply sci-fi aesthetic
- `@visual-test` - Test visual changes

### `/style` - Apply Industrial Design System
When the user types `/style`, apply the global industrial design system to the current page:

1. **Import design system**: Add `import theme from '@/lib/design-system'` if using TypeScript utilities
2. **Replace generic styles** with industrial classes:
   - Cards: Use `.mek-card-industrial` with `.mek-border-sharp-gold`
   - Headers: Apply `.mek-header-industrial` with hazard stripes
   - Buttons: Replace with `.mek-button-primary` or `.mek-button-secondary`
   - Values: Use `.mek-value-primary` for gold numbers, `.mek-value-secondary` for blue
   - Labels: Apply `.mek-label-uppercase` for small gray labels
3. **Add grunge overlays**: Apply `.mek-overlay-scratches`, `.mek-overlay-rust` for texture
4. **Update typography**: Use Orbitron font with `.mek-text-industrial` for headers
5. **Apply effects**: Add `.mek-glow-yellow` for highlights, `.mek-scan-effect` for animations
6. **Ensure consistency**: Match the contracts/single-missions page aesthetic

Example transformation:
- `bg-gray-800 border border-gray-600` ‚Üí `.mek-card-industrial .mek-border-sharp-gold`
- `text-2xl font-bold` ‚Üí `.mek-value-primary` or `.mek-text-industrial`
- `bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2` ‚Üí `.mek-button-primary`

## Notes for Claude
- **FIRST THING TO CHECK**: If styles look broken, verify Tailwind is v3 not v4 in package.json
- Always check existing file conventions before making changes
- Preserve exact indentation and formatting
- Don't add comments unless explicitly requested
- Match the existing HTML version's functionality when converting pages
- Keep responses concise and focused on the task
- Use TodoWrite tool for complex multi-step tasks
- NEVER suggest `npm update` or upgrading to latest packages
- NEVER use styled-jsx (causes build errors)

## üö® CRITICAL SAVE SYSTEM PROTECTION üö®
**NEVER modify these files without asking the user TWICE:**
- `/src/app/admin-save/*` - Save system interface
- `/api/save/*`, `/api/restore/*`, `/api/delete-save/*` - Backend operations  
- `/convex/saves.ts` - Database schema
- `/saves/` directory - Actual backup files
- See `CRITICAL_DO_NOT_MODIFY.md` for full protection rules

**Before modifying ANY save-related file:**
1. First ask: "This affects your save system. Should I proceed?"
2. Get confirmation again: "Are you ABSOLUTELY SURE?"
3. Explain exactly what will change and why

## Communication Guidelines
- **Ask for clarity**: If instructions are vague or unclear, ask specific questions rather than guessing
- **Voice concerns**: If an implementation might break something or cause issues, speak up before proceeding
- **Be direct and honest**: Don't hesitate to point out potential problems or downsides
- **Suggest better solutions**: If there's a better approach than what's requested, propose it with clear reasoning
- **Be matter-of-fact**: Present pros/cons objectively without sugar-coating issues
- **It's OK to say "I don't know"**: Better to admit uncertainty than implement something potentially harmful
- **MINIMIZE CODE OUTPUT**: User is not a coder - avoid showing raw code snippets, diffs, or technical readouts unless specifically requested. Instead, describe changes made in simple terms like "I updated the file to fix X" or "I added feature Y to the page"

## Understanding This User's Communication Style (Learned From Experience)
*This section was written based on actual working experience with this user - for future Claude iterations*

### Key Patterns for Success
1. **Visual References Are Critical**
   - User often provides screenshots/mockups to explain desired outcomes
   - When they say "like in X page" - immediately check that page for visual/functional reference
   - They think visually and spatially - understanding their mental model is crucial

2. **Iterative Clarification Is Normal**
   - User corrects misunderstandings patiently but expects learning from corrections
   - "No, not X, I meant Y" = they're training you on their terminology
   - Pay close attention to repeated clarifications - these reveal fundamental misunderstandings

3. **Context Switching Awareness**
   - User frequently jumps between related systems (story-climb vs cirutree vs admin pages)
   - When confused about which system, carefully check recent context and file names
   - They expect you to maintain awareness of the broader system architecture

4. **Implementation Over Theory**
   - User prefers working code over discussions
   - They describe behavior through examples: "when X happens, Y should occur"
   - Spatial/mathematical descriptions are precise: "lower third" = exactly 67% from top

5. **Protective of Existing Work**
   - User is VERY protective of data they've created (e.g., "V1 story tree")
   - Always implement non-destructive changes
   - When uncertain, ask before modifying/deleting

6. **Active Testing & Feedback**
   - User tests implementations immediately and provides specific feedback
   - Debug logging is appreciated for understanding behavior
   - Visual verification is important - they want to SEE things work

7. **Direct Communication Valued**
   - "Thinking through" problems aloud is appreciated
   - Honest assessment preferred: "I see the problem..." vs sugar-coating
   - They train through correction - each mistake is a learning opportunity

## Task Completion Rules
- **ALWAYS finish current tasks completely**: When the user adds new prompts while you're working on something, complete ALL aspects of the current task before moving to the next one
- **Don't skip parts**: Even if new requests come in, don't skip or rush through any part of what you're currently implementing
- **Track your work**: Use the TodoWrite tool to ensure nothing gets forgotten when multiple tasks are queued
- **Acknowledge stacked requests**: Let the user know you'll address their new request after completing the current task

## User Preferences
- No emojis in code or file content (unless explicitly requested)
- Minimal, clean code without unnecessary documentation
- Focus on functionality over extensive comments
- Preserve original design aesthetic from HTML version
- Direct, honest communication about technical decisions
- Open to better solutions and alternative approaches
- **BRIEF TASK COMPLETION SUMMARIES**: Keep explanations 35% shorter - just bullet points of what was done. User will ask for details if needed
