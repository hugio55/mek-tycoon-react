## Important Notes:

- Your Convex database is already deployed and will work with any of these options
- The site has 4000 mek images (400MB+) so upload might take a few minutes
- For Vercel/Netlify, they'll automatically handle the Next.js deployment

## Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` file contains:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - This is already set and will work in production

Choose any option above and your site will be live in minutes!
