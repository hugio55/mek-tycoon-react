# ðŸš€ EASIEST Way to Deploy Your Mek Tycoon Site

## Option 1: Continue with Vercel (You were almost there!)

In your terminal where you ran `npx vercel login`, choose:
1. **"Continue with Email"** (not GitHub)
2. Enter your email
3. Check your email for the login link
4. After login, run: `npx vercel --prod`
5. Your site will be live!

## Option 2: Use Render.com (FREE, No conflicts)

1. Go to https://render.com
2. Sign up with Google/GitHub/Email (different from Vercel)
3. Click "New +" â†’ "Static Site"
4. Connect your GitHub (or upload files)
5. Set build command: `npm run build`
6. Set publish directory: `.next`
7. Click "Create Static Site"

## Option 3: Railway.app (Super Fast)

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Choose "Deploy from GitHub" or "Deploy from Local"
4. Railway will auto-detect Next.js
5. Click Deploy!

## Option 4: For Immediate Sharing (Temporary)

Since your dev server is already running on localhost:3000, you can:

1. Download LocalTunnel:
   ```
   npm install -g localtunnel
   ```

2. Run:
   ```
   lt --port 3000 --subdomain mek-tycoon
   ```

3. Share the URL: `https://mek-tycoon.loca.lt`

This creates a temporary public URL to your local server - perfect for quick sharing!

**For Vercel:** Just use email login instead of GitHub and you'll be deployed in 1 minute!
