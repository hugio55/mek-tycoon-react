# 🔧 ZERO-DOWNTIME GOLD MIGRATION PLAN (Option B: Clean Migration)

**Created:** November 1, 2025
**Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS
**Last Updated:** November 1, 2025 - 11:30 PM

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Goal:** Fix all corrupted gold data, remove auto-repair code, add proper concurrency protection, and establish error detection for future bugs—all while players continue playing with zero downtime.

**Estimated Duration:** 2-4 hours (mostly automated)
**Player Impact:** ✅ NONE (game remains fully playable)
**Risk Level:** 🟢 LOW (multiple safety mechanisms)
**Reversibility:** ✅ MEDIUM (full data backups provided)

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### What Happened

The system encountered a critical gold invariant violation error:
```
Gold invariant violation: totalCumulativeGold < accumulatedGold + totalSpent
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **October 13, 2025**: `totalCumulativeGold` field was added to fix gold cap bug
- **Before this date**: Old records don't have this field (or have it set to 0)
- **Current state**: Auto-repair code masks the issue but logs scary errors
- **Additional issue**: Race condition in `updateGoldCheckpoint` (no version checking)

### Why Migration is Needed

Current auto-repair approach has downsides:
- ❌ Continuous error logs for every old record
- ❌ Can't distinguish "old data being fixed" vs "new bugs"
- ❌ Performance overhead checking every mutation
- ❌ Masks whether NEW violations are occurring

**Migration benefits:**
- ✅ Clean logs after migration
- ✅ NEW violations throw errors (catch bugs immediately)
- ✅ Faster (no auto-repair overhead)
- ✅ Clear separation: old data vs new bugs

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### If Migration Fails (Phase 2-3)
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Don't proceed to code changes
2. Run `restoreFromBackup` with confirmation code
   - Backup timestamp: `_______________`
   - Confirmation code: `RESTORE_CONFIRMED`
3. Investigate failure cause
4. Fix migration logic
5. Re-run from Phase 1

### If Code Changes Cause Errors (Phase 4)
1. **IMMEDIATELY REVERT** deployment (git revert)
2. Gold data remains intact (migration already complete)
3. Re-enable auto-repair temporarily while debugging
4. Fix bugs, test thoroughly in dev environment
5. Re-deploy when confident

### If New Corruption Detected (Phase 5)
1. **INVESTIGATE IMMEDIATELY** - This indicates a NEW bug
2. Check recent code changes for bugs
3. Review wallet's recent activity
4. Check for race conditions
5. Fix root cause before continuing
