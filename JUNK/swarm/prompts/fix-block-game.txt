URGENT: Fix Block Tower Game

The block stacking game at src/app/scrap-yard/block-game/BlockGame.tsx is not working properly. When clicking "Start Game", nothing appears.

KEY ISSUES TO FIX:
1. The original game uses geometry.applyMatrix() to offset the block pivot point to the corner (not center)
2. Uses THREE.Group() to manage newBlocks, placedBlocks, and choppedBlocks separately
3. Camera positioning is different (x:2, y:2, z:2 looking at 0,0,0)
4. Uses MeshToonMaterial not MeshPhongMaterial
5. Block dimensions start at 10x2x10
6. Speed calculation uses negative values
7. The game uses class-based architecture with Stage, Block, and Game classes

ORIGINAL CODE REFERENCE:
- Geometry uses: geometry.applyMatrix(new THREE.Matrix4().makeTranslation(width/2, height/2, depth/2))
- This offsets the pivot point to the corner instead of center
- Camera: OrthographicCamera with position (2, 2, 2) looking at (0, 0, 0)
- Background color: #D0CBC7
- Uses THREE.Groups to manage blocks
- MeshToonMaterial with specific color calculation

Please fix the BlockGame.tsx component to match the original game's behavior exactly.
