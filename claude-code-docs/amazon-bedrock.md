# Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock

> Learn about configuring Claude Code through Amazon Bedrock, including setup, IAM configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring Claude Code with Bedrock, ensure you have:

* An AWS account with Bedrock access enabled
* Access to desired Claude models (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4) in Bedrock
* AWS CLI installed and configured (optional - only needed if you don't have another mechanism for getting credentials)
* Appropriate IAM permissions

## Setup

### 1. Enable model access

First, ensure you have access to the required Claude models in your AWS account:

1. Navigate to the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)
2. Go to **Model access** in the left navigation
3. Request access to desired Claude models (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4)
4. Wait for approval (usually instant for most regions)

### 2. Configure AWS credentials

Claude Code uses the default AWS SDK credential chain. Set up your credentials using one of these methods:

**Option A: AWS CLI configuration**

```bash
aws configure
```

**Option B: Environment variables (access key)**

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your-session-token
```

**Option C: Environment variables (SSO profile)**

```bash
aws sso login --profile=<your-profile-name>

export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name
```

**Option D: Bedrock API keys**

```bash
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=your-bedrock-api-key
```

Bedrock API keys provide a simpler authentication method without needing full AWS credentials. [Learn more about Bedrock API keys](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerate-ai-development-with-amazon-bedrock-api-keys/).

#### Advanced credential configuration

Claude Code supports automatic credential refresh for AWS SSO and corporate identity providers.
