## What Claude Code does for you

* **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
* **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
* **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your team's codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with [MCP](/en/docs/claude-code/mcp) can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
* **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.

## Why developers love Claude Code

* **Works in your terminal**: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Claude Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
