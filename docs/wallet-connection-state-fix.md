# Wallet Connection State Management Fix

## Problem Summary

The wallet connection flow had three critical issues preventing users from canceling connection attempts on mobile:

1. **State Pollution**: `walletError` was used for both DApp browser instructions AND actual errors
2. **No Abort Mechanism**: Polling loop couldn't be cancelled once started
3. **No Cancel UI**: Connection status modal had no way to dismiss

## The Fix

### 1. Separated State Variables

**Before:**
```typescript
const [walletError, setWalletError] = useState<string | null>(null);
// Used for BOTH instructions AND errors
```

**After:**
```typescript
const [walletError, setWalletError] = useState<string | null>(null);
// Only for actual connection errors

const [walletInstructions, setWalletInstructions] = useState<string | null>(null);
// Only for DApp browser setup instructions
```

### 2. Added Polling Abort Capability

**New Refs:**
```typescript
const pollingIntervalRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);
// Stores interval ID so we can clear it
```

**Abort Function:**
```typescript
const cancelConnection = () => {
  // Stop polling
  if (pollingIntervalRef.current) {
    clearInterval(pollingIntervalRef.current);
    pollingIntervalRef.current = null;
  }

  // Reset all connection state
  setIsConnecting(false);
  setConnectionStatus('');
  connectionLockRef.current = false;
};
```

**Polling Loop Updated:**
```typescript
const pollInterval = setInterval(() => {
  pollingIntervalRef.current = pollInterval; // Store ID
  // ... polling logic
}, 500);
```

### 3. Updated UI Components

#### Connection Status Modal - Added Cancel Button
**Location:** Lines 2023-2065

**Before:**
- Just showed "CONNECTING..." with spinner
- No way to cancel

**After:**
```tsx
{isConnecting && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/80 backdrop-blur-sm z-50">
    {/* ... spinner and status ... */}

    {/* NEW: Cancel button */}
    <div className="flex justify-center mt-6">
      <button onClick={cancelConnection}>
        Cancel
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

#### Separated Modals for Instructions vs Errors
**Location:** Lines 2380-2442

**Instructions Modal** (for DApp browser setup):
```tsx
{walletInstructions && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 bg-black/80">
    {/* Full screen modal with instructions */}
    <button onClick={() => setWalletInstructions(null)}>
      Got It
    </button>
  </div>
)}
```

**Error Display** (inline, NOT a modal):
```tsx
{walletError && (
  <div className="mt-6 p-4 bg-red-900/10 border border-red-500/30">
    <span>{walletError}</span>
  </div>
)}
```

## State Flow Now

### DApp Browser Instructions Flow
1. User clicks wallet that needs DApp browser (e.g., Eternl)
2. `setWalletInstructions("1. Open app...")`
3. Full-screen **modal** appears with instructions
4. User can dismiss by clicking "Got It" or clicking outside
5. No error state set

### Connection Error Flow
1. Connection fails (timeout, signature rejected, etc.)
2. `setWalletError("Timeout waiting for wallet")`
3. **Inline red text** appears below wallet buttons
4. User can retry connection
5. No blocking modal

### Cancellation Flow
1. User starts connection (sees "CONNECTING..." modal)
2. User clicks "Cancel" button
3. `cancelConnection()` called:
   - Clears polling interval
   - Resets `isConnecting` to false
   - Resets `connectionStatus` to empty
   - Releases connection lock
4. Modal disappears, user back at wallet selection

## Before vs After User Experience

### Before (Broken)
1. User clicks Eternl wallet on mobile
2. Shows DApp instructions in modal
3. Also shows red error text underneath (duplicate!)
4. User dismisses modal
5. Starts deep link connection
6. Gets stuck in 60-second polling loop
7. NO WAY TO CANCEL
8. Must wait full 60 seconds or refresh page

### After (Fixed)
1. User clicks Eternl wallet on mobile
2. Shows DApp instructions in modal (clean, no duplicate errors)
3. User dismisses modal
4. Starts deep link connection for supported wallets
5. Sees "CONNECTING..." modal with status
6. Can click "Cancel" button any time
7. Polling stops immediately
8. Back to wallet selection

## Files Modified

- `src/app/mek-rate-logging/page.tsx`
  - Line 238: Added `walletInstructions` state
  - Line 243: Added `pollingIntervalRef`
  - Lines 987-1002: Added `cancelConnection` function
  - Line 1049: Use `setWalletInstructions` instead of `setWalletError`
  - Line 1113: Store polling interval ID in ref
  - Lines 2053-2061: Added cancel button to connection modal
  - Lines 2380-2432: Instructions modal (uses `walletInstructions`)
  - Lines 2434-2442: Error display (uses `walletError`, inline only)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Mobile: Click Eternl - should show instructions modal only
- [ ] Mobile: Dismiss instructions - should close cleanly
- [ ] Mobile: Click Flint - should show "CONNECTING..." modal
- [ ] Mobile: Click "Cancel" during connection - should abort immediately
- [ ] Desktop: Connection errors show as inline red text (not modal)
- [ ] Mobile: Can cancel during 60-second polling period
- [ ] Mobile: Polling stops when cancelled (check console logs)
- [ ] Mobile: Connection state resets properly after cancel

## Key Insights

### Why Separation Matters
Instructions are **informational** (not an error state):
- User needs to know how to connect
- Nothing went wrong
- No retry needed

Errors are **failure states**:
- Something actually failed
- User may want to retry
- Shows what went wrong

Mixing them caused:
- Confusing UX (modal + error text simultaneously)
- No clear distinction between "needs setup" vs "connection failed"
- Modal blocking when error should be inline

### Why Abort Mechanism Matters
Without cancellation:
- User trapped in 60-second wait
- Bad mobile UX (can't go back)
- Accidental clicks cause long delays
- No recovery from wrong wallet selection

With cancellation:
- User in control
- Quick recovery from mistakes
- Professional UX standard
- Reduces frustration

## Implementation Notes

The fix maintains backwards compatibility:
- All existing error paths still work
- Connection logic unchanged
- Only UI state management improved
- No breaking changes to Convex mutations
