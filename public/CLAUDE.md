# OUTDATED - DO NOT USE

**This file is outdated and should not be used.**

The current project instructions are in the ROOT `CLAUDE.md` file:
`C:\Users\Ben Meyers\Documents\Mek Tycoon\TYCOON REACT 8-27\mek-tycoon-react-staging\CLAUDE.md`

## Key Change (December 2025)

We now use a **UNIFIED SINGLE DATABASE** (Sturgeon - fabulous-sturgeon-691.convex.cloud).

- **Trout (wry-trout-962)** is DEPRECATED and no longer used
- **All backend changes affect production immediately**
- **See root CLAUDE.md for complete, up-to-date instructions**
