node mek-swarm.js "FIX BLOCK MOVEMENT: The blocks in src/app/scrap-yard/block-game/BlockGame.tsx are not visibly moving. The speed values are too small. Current speed is -0.15 but blocks still don't move visibly. The tick() function at line 257 adds this.direction to position[workingPlane] each frame. Need to increase the movement speed significantly (try multiplying by 10 or more) to make blocks actually move side to side visibly. The original CodePen version likely used requestAnimationFrame differently or had different timing."
