Think of this phase as \"the foundation\" for the intricate world that is Mek Tycoon."

With up to 10 Corporations per Federation, there will be plenty of competition on the global leaderboards. This phase will also include the community-requested features that have made it through the ranks over the course of P1-3. That said, it doesn't stop here at Phase 4... there are plenty of additions to come, but we consider this version of Mek Tycoon to be the first production release.
